# Driven2Know
This is the part of Driven responsible for organising and running hands-on workshops (we believe training is something that is done with monkeys). No death-by-powerpoint here. We regularly build custom workshops as well - if there is a particular software development related area you would like your company to focus on, [contact us](/Pages/ContactUs).
