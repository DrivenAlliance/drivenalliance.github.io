# Introduction to Agile : Kanban
<img src="/images/content/simple-kanban-board.png" class="image_left"/>
## What do we cover?
Scrum is currently the most popular Agile method in South Africa but it is certainly not the only one, and there are many situations that it's simply a bad fit. This doesn't mean that Agile is not for you though. The Kanban workshop is aimed at exposing teams to one of these alternatives - one that uses Lean principles and Kanban methodology. By using LEGO, learning is enhanced by means of team interaction and simulating business challenges.
