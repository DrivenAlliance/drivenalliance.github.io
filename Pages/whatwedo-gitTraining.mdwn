# Getting to Grips with Git

<img src="/images/git/shaft.png" style="float:left; width: 300px"/>


[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a source control system that is very fast, allows for easy branching and is fully distributed. This allows a development team to work collaboratively without stepping on each other's toes, keeping all changes version controlled, and having a master trunk that is ready to go into production at any time.

Getting to Grips with Git is one of our latest training courses. We will help you get up and running with Git with a balanced mixture of theory around git and practical sessions to get you over the initial learning curve of using Git.

## Who is it aimed at?

Tired of checking code into SVN that's only half done? Not able to branch and merge easily? Annoyed that the senior developers cannot check the junior developers' code before allowing it into the version control? Wanting more control over your source control? Tired of this old frustrating way of working? Getting to Grips with Git is for you!

## What do we cover?

* Git basics, installing Git and setting up a good merge editor
* Understanding Git and distributed version control
* Migrating away from old version controls without doing damage
* Work flows that support collaboration
* Understanding and using [Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
