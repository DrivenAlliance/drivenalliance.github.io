# Specification by Example / BDD

## What is Specification by Example / BDD?
Teams working in an Agile/Scrum environment commonly use Stories to track and prioritize feature requirements. But given an individual Story, how do you know when you are done with it?

- When is coding finished?
- When does testing start?
- When is it coded & tested?
- Coded, tested and deployed?
- Coded, tested, deployed and verified by the Customer?
<br>
Enter "Executable Specifications". Creating acceptance criteria for a Story tells you where to start and when to stop. Automating them allows you to regularly test that nothing has broken. Executable Specifications are the missing glue that ties the pipeline together (BDD stands for 'Behaviour Driven Development', and really is just another commonly used name for the same thing.).

Unfortunately, getting it right is tricky and, more so than ever; there are no one-size-fits-all silver bullets.


## What do we cover?
In this workshop attendees we cover the theory and good practice required to implement the practice. We will use C#, SpecFlow and NUnit to code a real-world example, demonstrating one way of achieving success. We will also address common pitfalls and anti-patterns that you should try to avoid.

## Who is the workshop aimed at?
The whole team and their customer(s). This workshop is most effective when there is a full spectrum of viewpoints present. SBE is a collaborative practice and not the sole domain of any single skill set. Programmers, testers, business people and customers will all learn their role in the writing of specifications.

## Learning Objective:
- Make the concepts of Specification by Example more tangible
- Jump start introduction to automating specifications through coding a real-world example
- Understand some of the challenges, particularly in a static language environment
