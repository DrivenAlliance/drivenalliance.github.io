# Driven Software's Mission
<br>
Driven Software's mission is to provide South African businesses with an independent technical partner with whom they can undertake their software solution development efforts. We believe our hands-on approach to working with our clients is a positive contrast to the 'ivory tower' style of consulting currently offered in the market. 


# Driven Software's Philosophy
<br>
At our core is a belief in people-focused, iterative ways of delivering solutions. By adopting, and adapting, tools and techniques from both in the field experience and formalised teaching from Agile philosophies, Driven Software successfully supports organisations in developing sustainable working environments and methodologies.

There are specific engineering practices that should be followed in order to deliver successfully and continuously, and we provide coaching, workshop environments and tactical placements that assist the adoption of these practices.

We believe in a disciplined and holistic approach, firmly grounded in the specific needs and requirements of our Clients.  We have extensive experience in the implementation of Scrum, XP, as well as Kanban and the use of the principles of Lean software development. 


# Driven Software's Approach
<br>
One of the fundamental principles of our approach is to recognise that every company, every team and every project is different. There is no one size fits all solution to building software well, only principles and practices that when used in the right combinations for the specific circumstances will result in success.
