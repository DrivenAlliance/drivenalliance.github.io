### Agenda

Rinat Abdullin will commence the workshop by covering general software craftsmanship topics. Vaughn Vernon will develop these ideas further, introducing the basics of Domain Driven Design (DDD), and how to get started by embracing a craftsman's mentality, engaging with domain experts to develop a Ubiquitous Language in a software model, and using good software design techniques to properly divide modeling concerns and responsibilities.

Over the two days we will cover many related topics including...

- Strategic Design - learning how to properly use Bounded Contexts, Subdomains, and Context Mapping
- How Architecture plays a role in DDD, and how to avoid improper use
- Eight precision DDD Tactical Modeling tools that help developer implement the Ubiquitous Language in a domain model, and details of best practices.
- Various powerful techniques for integrating Bounded Contexts by realizing Context Maps in source code, and how your surrounding application components fit in to a DDD initiative
- A+ES and Event Store concepts
- Much more, depending on the kinds of issues attendees bring with them to discuss!
<br>
### Who should attend

Go beyond the theory of DDD and see how teams can actually use DDD to accelerate their strategic initiatives in a way that helps them design for the businessâ€™ competitive advantage. Emphasis is placed on software development as a craft by embracing best practices of design in source code that works within the framework of agile processes, and de-emphasizes attempts to solve real strategic business software initiatives by throwing technology at the problem.

The event is best for senior and mid-level software developers and architects interested in software craftsmanship and learning domain modeling using the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach.
