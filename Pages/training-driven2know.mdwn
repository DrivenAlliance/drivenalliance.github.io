## What is Git?

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that allows a development team to work collaboratively without stepping on each other's toes, tracking all changes and making it very easy to share them effectively. It is far more effective than traditional Version Control Systems (CVS, Subversion, TFS etc).


## Who is the course aimed at?

Developers, Testers, Designers - anyone working in a collaborative team environment, particularly when the team is geographically distributed.


## What do we cover?

We will help you get up and running with Git with a balanced mixture of theory and practical sessions, split over two morning sessions...
Driven’s Git Workshop Course is a practical, hands-on, one day program split into two sessions...

### SESSION ONE : USE
At the end of session one attendees will understand the major features of Git and have the knowledge to use it effectively.

### SESSION TWO : ADOPT
At the end of the second session attendees will understand more about using Git in a collaborative environment.
They will be aware of how to transition to Git from other version control systems, integrate it with external applications as well as common patterns for adapting their team process to best leverage it.
