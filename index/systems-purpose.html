	<h4>Why we do it</h4>
	For people who want to understand and solve problems that go beyond the code and want to understand 'how the work works'.
	<h4>What's in it for others</h4>
	Improve the understanding of the fundamental ways in which their personal, team and organisational systems behave and to work with them to build systems that meet their needs.
