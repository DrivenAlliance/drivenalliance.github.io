In Karate, [Katas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_kata) are practice routine patterns that are performed repeatedly whilst trying to maintain perfect form. The concept is that through visualisation and repetition of perfect practice the student internalises and masters the movements involved. Code Katas are designed for the same purpose. They are simple problems that can be coded repetitively, each time trying to be a little more perfect than the time before. For more information, [this](http://www.codekata.com/) is a good place to start.
