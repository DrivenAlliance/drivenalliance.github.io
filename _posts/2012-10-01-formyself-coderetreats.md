To be a great musician you need to practice constantly. Perhaps, if you get good enough, one day you will get to perform. As a software developer though, it is all about performance - we create very few opportunites to practice. Coderetreat is one of these opportunities. It's a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. And its fun at the same time.
