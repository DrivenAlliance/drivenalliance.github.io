There is no better way to introduce development practices like Software Craftsmanship, TDD and Pair Programming to your company than through running an internal Coderetreat. It's a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. And its fun at the same time.

Find more info [here](/Pages/Workshops/driven2know-Coderetreat), and [contact us](/Pages/ContactUs) for more info (minimum 16 people, but can be combined with other companies).
