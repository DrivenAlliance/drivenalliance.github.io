# Driven Software's History

The company was founded in 2008 by Kevin Trethewey. After many years of keenly observing the projects and people he worked with as a developer and consultant he formed a vision of creating a company that specialised in helping people to change the way they looked at software and how it should be produced.

Since then, adopting and adapting tools and techniques from both in the field experience and formalised teaching from eXtreme Programming, Scrum, Kanban and other Agile philosophies, Driven Software has helped [many teams](/Pages/ClientPortfolio "Client Porfolio") to sustainably and repeatedly produce amazing results.
