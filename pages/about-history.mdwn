# Driven Software's History
<br>

Driven was founded in 2008 with a vision to create a company that specialised in helping people to change the way they looked at software and how to produce it.

The core focus of Driven is to identify, analyse and advise on the potential synergies and disparities within the business- and development environment.  This is performed effectively using the engineering principles and practices that are required for success in an agile environment.

By adopting, and adapting, tools and techniques from both in the field experience and formalised teaching from Agile philosophies including eXtreme Programming, Scrum, Kanban amongst many, Driven Software has successfully supported many teams to develop sustainable working environments and methodologies.
